# spectrum_measurement_suite

Spectrum measurement suite used for PhD research. Contains CUDA accelerated module for performing energy estimation of observed spectrum samples. 3 primary modes: viewing live samples from an Ettus Research USRP (n210 and X300 tested), module for streaming samples from USRP to hard drive, module for retreiving samples, performing energy estimation and resource identification as per: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7986360

Will require installation of Ettus Research UHD Drivers, Boost (C++) and CUDATools.
